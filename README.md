A simple drag-and-drop form builder application that allows users to drag fields like headers, input fields, checkboxes, and dropdowns to a drop zone, customize their content, and see the live preview.

Features
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Drag elements (Header, Input, Checkbox, Select) from the left side to the drop zone.
Live Preview: See a live preview of the form based on the elements placed in the drop zone.
Clear Button: Clear all the elements in the drop zone with a single button.

Technologies Used
React: The core JavaScript library used to build the UI and manage state.
React-DnD: A library used to handle drag-and-drop functionality.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.

Future improvements
The design could have a more polished, modern look with smoother animations and transitions.
Some forms require more flexibility in layout than just a vertical stack of fields.
While dragging, show an immediate preview of how the form element will look in real time, including text changes (e.g., changing the label text, placeholder, etc.) without dropping it first."# Task3"
